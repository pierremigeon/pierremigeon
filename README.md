- 👀 I’m interested in genetics, C, python, SQL, data, software testing (not necessarily in that order!)
- 🌱 Love online learning, and learning in general. Autodidactic.
- 💞️ Seeking either manual QA internships / jobs or bioinformatics and data positions.
- 📫 Email me @ pi3rre.migeon@gmail.com. I have many social medias, always respond to people, and am happy to engage.
