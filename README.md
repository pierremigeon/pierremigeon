- 👋 Hello, I am @pierremigeon
- 🌱 I am curious and autodidactic. I'm constantly reading, tinkering and taking online courses.
- 🔬 I have degrees in biology and genetics and a background in scientific research (specifically, genomics).
- 👀 I’m interested in genetics, C, python, SQL, data, software testing (among other things, and not necessarily in that order)
- 👨‍💻 Seeking either manual QA internships / jobs or bioinformatics and data positions.
- 📫 Email me @ pi3rre.migeon@gmail.com. I have many social medias, always respond to people, and am happy to engage.
